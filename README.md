# README for Github Account
This is a Github account with repo's for various school and personal projects that I've been working on - only the ones that I can share without violating course policy.

To view research/work-related projects - that I can share openly - as well as non-tech personal projects, please visit https://linkedin.com/in/nitanu32 and scroll to my projects & publications.
